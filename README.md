# Web Application for Food Delivery Restaurants

This project was an attempt at do scraping at the click of a button and display results in quick real time.
The web application gathers all the restaurants and their related attributes like area, cuisine, cost for two, delivery time and discount percentage at the moment you use the application.

URL of the app: https://swiggy-menu-download.herokuapp.com/

How to use:
1. Type in your address (in India) and select relevant address from suggestions
2. Once you click submit, you will download a csv file with the attributes mentioned

Sample of the downloaded file:

I used this project almost everyday before ordering from Swiggy (delivery platform), now have developed this into a small web app.
